Odin Project Fullstack JS

Chronological: 
- Up to JS: OOP lesson. 
	- Two projects to do. 	1. Resturaunt Page, to generate HTML content with JS only, not that important or critical to spend time on
				2. To-Do, good for OOP principles and modules. Many list it as a good project for portfolio. May circle back on this later. . . Though Library seems similar enough and same functionality with more extension later on w. DB's


For Schnerp: 
- Focus on API's, DB's and React sections as per Dan's recommendation.
- Will skip some similar / unneeded project to learn more relevant content.
